        <h1>Objective of the Activity Done</h1>
        <h2>SURVEY ON THE RANGE OF AWARENESS OF INTERNET USAGE IN VILLAGE</h2>
        <h2>Detailed Report:</h2>
        <h3>On day 1: Introduction</h3>
        <p>Our team initiated the internet fraud awareness campaign in the village by engaging with local leaders and community members. We discussed the prevalence of internet fraud and its impact on individuals and families. The importance of staying vigilant and informed was emphasized, setting the tone for the days ahead.</p>
        <h3>On day 2: Educational Sessions</h3>
        <p>Today, we conducted educational sessions to equip villagers with the knowledge needed to identify and prevent internet fraud. We covered common tactics used by fraudsters, such as phishing and identity theft, and provided practical tips on how to stay safe online. Participants actively participated, eager to learn and protect themselves from potential threats.</p>
        <h3>On day 3: Interactive Workshops</h3>
        <p>Building on yesterday's lessons, we organized interactive workshops to deepen understanding and reinforce key concepts. Villagers engaged in role-playing scenarios to simulate real-life internet fraud situations, honing their ability to recognize warning signs and respond effectively. The hands-on approach was well-received, fostering a sense of empowerment among participants.</p>
        <h3>On day 4: Digital Literacy Training</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the importance of digital literacy in combating internet fraud, we dedicated today to providing hands-on training on essential digital skills. From creating strong passwords to securely navigating online transactions, villagers gained practical insights into safeguarding their online presence. The session concluded with a discussion on the ethical use of technology and the importance of responsible online behavior.</p>
        <h3>On day 5: Awareness Walk and Outreach</h3>
        <p>To amplify our message, we organized an awareness walk through the village, engaging with residents and distributing informational materials. Villagers enthusiastically joined the walk, spreading awareness to neighbouring communities and encouraging others to prioritize online safety. Additionally, we conducted outreach programs at local schools and community centres, reaching a wider audience with our message.</p>
        <h3>On day 6: Reflection and Future Planning</h3>
        <p>As we concluded our six-day campaign, we took time to reflect on our achievements and evaluate the impact of our efforts. Villagers shared their experiences and expressed gratitude for the knowledge gained during the program. Looking ahead, we discussed strategies for sustaining awareness and fostering a culture of cybersecurity in the village. Collaborative efforts between community members and local authorities were highlighted as essential for ongoing vigilance against internet fraud.</p>
